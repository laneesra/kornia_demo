# Kornia Demo [EfficientDL]

A demonstration of [`kornia`](https://github.com/kornia/kornia) library.

`kornia` is a computer vision library for PyTorch, inspired by OpenCV and with strong GPU support.

## Pros
- **Differentiable.** PyTorch backend, reverse-mode auto-differentiation to define and compute the gradient of complex functions.
- **Transparent API**. Algorithms can either be run in CPU or GPU.
- **Parallel programming**. Batch processing, working with multispectral or hyperspectral images.
- **Distributed**. Ð¡ommunication primitives for multi-process parallelism across several computation nodes running on one or more machines. 
- **Production**. Serializing and optimizing models for production purposes due to PyTorch backend.

##Demo running 
How to install the library: `pip install kornia`

To run the demo, you need to run a notebook with a GPU device, Google Colab is also suitable for this. All the necessary dependencies are placed inside the notebook.
